# AtlasIpAccessListDetector

This is a fairly simple script that uses the Atlas Admin API to
walk through all the projects in a Organization and print out any
project that has entries in the IP Access List.

To run:
1. npm install
2. set environment variables for the API Key
- API_PUBLIC_KEY
- API_PRIVATE_KEY
3. node index.js
